<span>Spot elevations across the City of Chesapeake. The points were created by 
using the ArcGIS &quot;Create Random Points&quot; tool and used the extent of the USGS DEM 
mosaic. The &quot;Extract Values to Points&quot; tool was then used to extract the values 
of the DEM to the random points. The elevations of the result are given in 
NAVD88(feet). Random points that fell within the hydropoly feature class (as of 
3/16/15) were excluded from the final output. Elevations are based on a 
&quot;bare-earth.&quot; </span>
