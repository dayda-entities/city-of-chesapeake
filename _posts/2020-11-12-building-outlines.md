<p>The original building outlines were created from the 2005 Pictometry aerial imagery. The Building Class field was added from the 2011 Community Basemap project and the type 'apartment' was added to that domain in 2011. New building outlines were acquired from the 2011-2012 Pictometry flight and replaced the whole layer joining previous attribute information where possible. Building outlines and change analysis were completed again with the Pictometry flight in 2014. Building outlines and change analysis were completed with the Pictometry flight in 2016. The latest building outlines were captured from the 2018 Pictometry flight and include fields for change detection. Use the Status field to exclude Demolished buildings. Outlines include decks. <span>Building classifications are </span><span>1=General/Residential, 2=Government, 3=Medical, 4=Education, 5=Transportation, 6=Commercial, 7=Religious, 8=Recreation, 9=Cultural/Heritage, 10=Hospitality, 11=Airport, 12=Industrial, 13=CommunityCenter, 14=Apartment</span></p>
