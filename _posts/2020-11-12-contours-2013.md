<p><span>2 foot contour lines in Chesapeake, VA. Contours were generated from a regional bare earth DEM from the USGS resampled from 2.5ft grids to 20ft grids. The resampling allows for smoother, more cartographic contours. The DEM was hydro-flattened and reviewed at 1:5000. Elevations are in NAVD88(feet). Contours generated that measured less than 50 in the Shape_Length field were removed. Elevations are based on a &quot;bare-earth.&quot; Data is for reference only.</span></p>
